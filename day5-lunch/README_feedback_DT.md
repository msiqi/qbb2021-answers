Really great work!! Nothing you need to change. A couple of notes:
1. In your allele frequency spectrum, you've labelled the y-axis as "number of occurences in population". Just to clarify, the y-axis should be the number of variable sites across the genome that have the given alternate allele frequency. It is the allele frequency that is defined within the population.
2. In your PCA plot for male vs. female, it might be helpful to set the alpha value below 1 so that you can see both the male and female points.
