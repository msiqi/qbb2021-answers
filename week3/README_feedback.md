Hi Siqi! 
- For the Manhattans, the x axis should be separated by chromosome and preferably with alternating colors (see past papers for examples). (-0.25)
We'd like you to also label the top 5 most significant SNPS (on each Manhattan) with their rsIDs (-0.25)
- For the qqplots, usually one plots that red line to help compare the expected vs observed p-values and see whether the observed deviate from the expected. 
Can you check out past papers to see what that line should be and add it to your plots? (-0.25)
- Great job labelling the boxplot! I knew exactly which dataset and SNP we were looking at :-)
