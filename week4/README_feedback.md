Hi Siqi, 

I see a few things missing in this assignment 
- It doesn't look like you did the necessary `deduplicate` or mapping steps (-1) 
- The histograms should show the cumulative methylation scores occurring in each promoter for E4 and E5.5 cells, respectively (-1) 
- The scatter should show the promoter methylation scores (with E4 on one axis and E5.5 on the other) (-1) 

2/5
