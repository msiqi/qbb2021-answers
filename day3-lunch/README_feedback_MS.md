Overall, your code looks great. You comments are informative, your variable names are clear, and the reasoning behind you choices is reasonable and logical.

The code will function as expected in almost all cases. But, it's really helpful to try and write your code as general as possible, i.e. to work in all cases, including those strange rare cases (edge cases). For example, if the gtf file only had one gene, the loop would go forever.

I think it would be a good learning exercise if you wanted a challenge to try writing a general binary search algorithm (simply takes an ordered list and returns what index a query would be placed at). Then use that and put your tests for determining which gene is closest afterwards. You'll find that binary searching comes up alot and having already written a general function to do it could be handy.

It's clear that you have a good handle on the concepts and construction of a program.

Great job. Keep it up!
