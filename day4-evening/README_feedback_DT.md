Really great work! In particular, your figures look very clean and are well-labeled. One small issue, that you actually noticed yourself:
1. In section 9, you're testing whether there is a significant difference between the number of paternally-inherited dnms, and maternally-inherited dnms. You did this two different ways and got two different p-values. The first way, you did an independent t-test using the `scipy.stats` module. The second way, you did OLS between the count of paternal or maternal dnms and the parent of origin. These are both acceptable ways to do this, and I think the only reason you got different p-values was because when doing the t-test, you removed the first row of the two columns you were working with (for example, you did `df_dnm_age.loc[:,"pat_dnm"][1:]`). I don't think the `[1:]` actually removes the header line, I think it just removes the first row. Try taking that out and seeing if you get the same p-value.
