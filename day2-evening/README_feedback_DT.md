Really great work! No need to change anything, but here are a few notes:
1. When you read in the files, you do the following: `target_file = open("/Users/cmdb/qbb2021/data/"+str(sys.argv[1]))`. Typically we don't want to assume the path to the input files. The user (you in this case), can input the full filepath in the command line, and they may not have the same file path as you, so it's probably better to have the user explicity write out the filepath to the file they want in the command line argument.
2. I suspect generating a new dictionary for each target sequence is probably a bit slow. You could speed this up, I think, by creating a dicionary that stores the kmers from ALL of the target sequences, with the target sequence they're found in and the position within that sequence. But this approach certainly works.
